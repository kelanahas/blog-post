# Blog entry for wednesday, April 24 2019

My day has been ultimately exhausting because of a terrible tooth ache, the pain is excruciating and like no other pain I've experienced in my life. It's an infected nerve sitting right next to my incoming wisdom tooth/sinus cavity. _Ouch_. The dentist referred me to an oral surgeon for an extraction and prescribed me pain medication/antibiotics. Time to get insurance...yikes! 
I can't stop thinking about Thailand. I was only traveling for the month of March, but a month is *not* enough! It was my beautiful happy place and I _need_ to save up money to go back and hopefully live there as soon as I can!

Here I am in Ayutthaya, the ancient capital of Siam

And here is my brother, Kai and me in Satun doing a beach clean up on one of the surrounding islands of Koh Lipe
